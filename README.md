# Car-Rental-App


This is my graduate project at John Bryce College. 
A full stack Car Rental application.

The Server Side written in C#. 
The server Side includes three layers: 
1.	I Entity Framework in based on mocked data from sql Data Base. 
2.	Logic – includes functions that invoked by the controller, and uses the EF in order to return the requested data. 
3.	WEB APi – includes the controllers, that gets the http request and calls the relevant function. 

The Client Side written in Angular CLI 7.0. Inside "03 – ClientSide" you will find another README, specifying the way to install and run an Angular project
